Given two vectors **c₁** and **c₂** in ℝⁿ, sort each vector in non-decreasing order to obtain **c₁↑** and **c₂↑**. Compute the total difference **D** by summing the absolute differences of corresponding elements:

$$
D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left| \left( \mathbf{c}_1^{\,\uparrow} \right)_i - \left( \mathbf{c}_2^{\,\uparrow} \right)_i \right|
$$
